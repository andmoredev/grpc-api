# Benefits of Application Load Balancer (ALB) vs Network Load Balancer (NLB) for gRPC

## Application Load Balancer Benefits
1. **TLS Termination**: ALB can handle SSL/TLS termination, reducing the complexity in your application
2. **Path-based Routing**: Can route based on URL paths, useful for multiple services
3. **HTTP/2 Support**: Native support for HTTP/2 which is required for gRPC
4. **Health Check Features**: More sophisticated health checks including path-based checks
5. **WebSocket Support**: Built-in WebSocket support which can be useful for streaming gRPC
6. **Authentication Integration**: Can integrate with authentication services
7. **Request Tracing**: Better request tracing and monitoring capabilities

## Network Load Balancer Benefits
1. **Lower Latency**: Works at Layer 4, providing slightly lower latency
2. **Static IP Support**: Can have static IP addresses
3. **Preserves Source IP**: Preserves client IP address
4. **Protocol Support**: Supports TCP/UDP/TLS protocols
5. **Higher Performance**: Can handle millions of requests per second

## Why ALB is Better for gRPC in this Case
1. ALB's HTTP/2 support is ideal for gRPC which requires HTTP/2
2. Built-in health check functionality works well with gRPC health checks
3. TLS termination at the load balancer simplifies the application architecture
4. Better monitoring and tracing capabilities for debugging
5. Path-based routing enables future microservices expansion
